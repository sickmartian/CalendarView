### API

The API for getting the pressed, current and/or selected day works via the **DayMetadata** class. `DayMetadata` is just a value holder for the day, month and year. It takes the months of the year starting with 1 (so January is 1, December is 12, like joda-time does)

Some methods also have a `Calendar` alternative that is just there for convenience, in this case the Day, Month and Year values will be read directly, no timezone awarenes is built in.

Adding views to the view group can be done via the day of the month for the `MonthView` (`addViewToDayInCurrentMonth`) or using `DayMetadata` for the `WeekView` (`addViewToDay`).

Alternatively you can use the cell id (`addViewToCell`), this is not perfect as the state won't be preserved on rotation in some cases but at least allows you to add data to neightbor months when using `MonthView`.

First day of the week is set like this
```java
  mCalendarView.setFirstDayOfTheWeek(CalendarView.SUNDAY_SHIFT);
```

### In Action
This library powers the [Trackendar app that you can find on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sickmartian.calendartracker) download it to see it in a production scenario

Alternatively just clone the repo and submodule using:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/sickmartian/CalendarView.git`

The sample app that's on the screenshots can be used to test the library.
